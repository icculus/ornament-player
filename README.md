# ornament-player

This is a dirt-simple SDL3 program that just renders an Ogg Theora file to
a window.

This is hooked up to a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with a
[Pimoroni Pirate Audio Speaker](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-audio-mini-speaker),
and a [PiSugar S](https://www.pisugar.com/) battery, with a case around it
to look like a Christmas tree ornament.

It's sort of a special-case thing, but if it works for you, feel free to
steal it.
